## Description

A program that checks to see if words are anagrams or antigrams while rejecting inputs that are not words.

## Rules
* If a true anagram is inputted it will return true. (ex. ruby and bury will be true)
* If words have strange capitalization, the program will still run. (ex. rUBy and BurY will be true)
* If words are not anagrams and are indeed an antigram, the program will return false/an error message. (ex. ruby and broomstick will be false)
* If words are multiple words or a phrase, the program will remove spaces and characters and still return the correct value (ex. school master and the classroom will be true)
* If words are not real words (if they contain vowels or not), the program will return an error message about real words. (ex. cwth and kjlp will return an error message about vowels)
